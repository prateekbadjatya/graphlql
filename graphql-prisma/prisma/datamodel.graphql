#prisma automatically genrate some query, mutatiom and subscription
#we just need to use it

# The @unique that comes after our ID field definition. What we have right here is a GraphQL directive.
# A directive is a way to modify the behavior of the field.
# Now, directives are usually something that we need to create and then use, but clearly we haven't created anything called unique in our code.
# This one is actually coming from Prisma, So Prisma provides us with various things to make our life a little bit easier.

# And the @unique directive, as the name suggests, makes a given field unique.
